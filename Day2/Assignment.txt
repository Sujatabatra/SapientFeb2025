Exercise 1: In yesterday example,create a super class called Animal and make all the existing classes as the sub class for Animal class. Move the method isVegetarian and canClimb to the super class 
and implement generically. Whenever necessary change the implementation of these methods in the respective subclasses.Display the characteristic of each animal.

Exercise 2:Create a class called Shape3D with the following method signatures volume () and surfaceArea (). Then create subclasses like Cylinder, Sphere, and Cube etc and implement these methods.


Exercise 3:Create a class called shape with the following methods
1.	area
2.	perimeter

                    Overload the area and perimeter method to calculate for both square and rectangle.
                    Create a main class and invoke the area method to calculate the area of the square and rectangle. Also invoke the perimeter method to calculate the perimeter of the square 
and rectangle.
